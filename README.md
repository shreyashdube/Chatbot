Chatting Application is a desktop based application. 
This client server chat application is based on java swing and used socket package. its
simple and easy and require only core java knowledge. I have taken this program from 
internet and modified a little bit to make it simpler and more elegant.
This application/program is a good example of using java.io, java.net package to create a 
chat application. A beginner of java language, who is familiar with this packages can 
able, be beneficiate.
Chatting is a method of using technology to bring people and ideas “together” 
despite of the geographical barriers. The technology has been available for years 
but the acceptance it was quit recent. Our project is an example of a multiple 
client chat server.
It is made up of 2 applications the client application, which runs on the user’s 
Pc and server application,which runs on any Pc on the network. To start 
chatting client should get connected to server. We will focus on TCP and UDP 
socket connections which are a fundamental part of socket programming. 
Keywords: sockets, client-server, Java network programming-socket 
functions, Multicasting etc.
